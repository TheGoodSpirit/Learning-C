The program includes the necessary header files for input/output operations (stdio.h) and standard library functions (stdlib.h).

###In the main function:
Integer variable op and float variables num1 and num2 are declared to store the user's input.

The user is prompted to enter the first number using printf and scanf, with the format specifier %f for float.

The user is prompted to enter the second number using printf and scanf, also using %f.

A menu of available operations is displayed using printf. The user is prompted to enter the operation choice using scanf with %d format specifier to read an integer.
The program uses a switch statement to perform the selected operation:

If op is 1, it calculates the addition of num1 and num2 and prints the result using printf.

If op is 2, it calculates the subtraction of num2 from num1 and prints the result.

If op is 3, it calculates the multiplication of num1 and num2 and prints the result.

If op is 4, it calculates the division of num1 by num2 and prints the result.

If none of the above cases match, it returns 0 (exiting the program). The result of the calculation is printed to the console using printf.

###Note: 
The code assumes that the user will provide valid input and doesn't handle cases such as division by zero or invalid input.
