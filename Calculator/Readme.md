The program includes the necessary header files for input/output operations (stdio.h) and memory allocation (stdlib.h).

The calculate function is declared at the beginning. It takes two integer arguments (num1 and num2) and returns an integer value.

# In the main function:
Two integer variables num1 and num2 are declared to store the user's input.
The user is prompted to enter the first number using printf and scanf.
The user is prompted to enter the second number using printf and scanf.
The calculate function is called with num1 and num2 as arguments, and the result is printed using printf.

# The calculate function:
Declares integer variables res to store the result and op to store the user's choice of operation.
Displays a menu of available operations using printf.
Prompts the user to enter the operation choice using scanf.

# Uses a switch statement to perform the selected operation:
If op is 1, it adds num1 and num2 and stores the result in res.
If op is 2, it subtracts num2 from num1 and stores the result in res.
If op is 3, it multiplies num1 and num2 and stores the result in res.
If op is 4, it divides num1 by num2 and stores the result in res.
If none of the above cases match, it returns 0 (indicating an invalid operation).
Finally, the res value is returned to the main function.

# Note: 
The code assumes that the user will provide valid input (i.e., the second number is not zero when performing division). It does not handle cases such as division by zero or invalid input, which could result in unexpected behavior or errors.
