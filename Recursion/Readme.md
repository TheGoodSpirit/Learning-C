The program includes the necessary header files for input/output operations (stdio.h) and standard library functions (stdlib.h).

The factor function is declared at the beginning. It takes an integer argument number and returns an integer value.

# In the main function:

An integer variable number is declared to store the user's input.
The user is prompted to enter a number using printf and scanf.
The factor function is called with number as an argument, and the factorial of the number is printed using printf.

# The factor function:
Checks if the input number is equal to 0. If it is, it returns 1 because the factorial of 0 is defined as 1.

If the input number is not equal to 0, it recursively calls the factor function with number-1 as an argument and multiplies the result by the original number.
The recursive calls continue until number becomes 0, at which point the function starts returning the factorial values back up the call stack.
The factorial of the input number is printed in the main function using printf.

The code correctly calculates the factorial of a number using recursion. However, note that it assumes the input number is non-negative, as the factorial is not defined for negative numbers.
