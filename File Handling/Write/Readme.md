The program includes the necessary header files for input/output operations (stdio.h) and standard library functions (stdlib.h).

# In the main function:
A character array name is declared to store the user's name.
A pointer variable test of type FILE is declared to represent the file.
The file named "test.txt" is opened in write mode using the fopen function. If the file doesn't exist, a new file with the given name is created. If the file already exists, its previous content will be truncated.

The program prompts the user to enter their name using printf and reads the input using scanf, storing it in the name array.

The user's name is written to the file using fprintf with the format specifier %s. This will write the contents of the name array to the file.

Finally, the file is closed using fclose.

It's important to note that when opening the file in write mode ("w"), the previous content of the file, if any, will be deleted. If you want to append the new content to the existing content of the file, you can use the append mode "a" instead of write mode.
